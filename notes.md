### [Using Neural Networks to solve Ordinary Differential Equations](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-neural-networks-to-solve-ordinary-differential-equations-a7806de99cdd)

Uses TensorFlow to solve a simple ODE. It's based on the Lagaris article and includes
a Google Collab Notebook. I converted it to a python script for ease of use.

## Books

### *Applied Neural Networks with TensorFlow 2.0* - Gazi

Chapter 5 has a good intro the Keras Api to build Sequential or Functional models and
customized learning loops.

Chapter 6 has some examples of feedforward neural networks.
